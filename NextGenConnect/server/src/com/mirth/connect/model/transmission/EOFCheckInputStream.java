/**
 * An EOFCheckInputStream adds functionality to another InputStream that detects when a -1 is first
 * read from the underlying stream, and doesn't allow any subsequent reads after that (all calls to
 * read() will result in -1). This is useful for sockets that are persisted across multiple reads
 * because it prevents an unnecessary SocketTimeoutException from occurring. To continue reading
 * from a socket using this stream, you can either call reset() to a previously marked position, or
 * you can wrap the socket stream in a new instance of EOFCheckInputStream.
